# Notes

These are Kicad files for the new amplifier design. The current schematic specifies an NE5532 however the darlington pairs that will make up the 
B+ can supply substantially more power than the original and I am considering using OPA541AM's in the final design. This will require more 
passive cooling for the opamps in addition to the darlington pairs (currently considering TIP122 and it's counterpart.)
